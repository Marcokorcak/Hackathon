# Project Emotion (Hackathon 2021)
This is my Hackathon 2021 project that used Xcode and Swift

### App Description
For this years Hackathon my teammate and I decided to make an app that calms users and provides them with a support sstem. We felt that during the panddemic a lot of teens are overwhelmed and are stressed so we decided to make an app where the user can chose how they are feeling and ranking it on a number line. While relitively being new to Swift and Xcode I implamented images, sound effects, and motivational/supporting quotes to provide the user with a virtual support system. The intent of the app is to brighten the users day and reassure them that they will get through the problems they are facing.
